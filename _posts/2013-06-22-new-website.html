<p>Two years ago I built a basic website when I was just getting into web design and development. I never really used it for what I originally intended, and as a result it went untouched for a while. It even became embarassing.</p>
<p>For a while I had been meaning to rebuild it, but I wanted to do it right; something I would stay happy with. I finally set aside the time for it, and have spent the last few weeks working through different revisions.</p>
<br>
<p>Below are the goals I outlined:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Clean, minimal design</li>
	<li>Support for all screen sizes</li>
	<li>Keep it fast</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>To tackle those goals, I used the following technologies and services:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Jekyll - compiles to a static site which eliminates the need for a web server</li>
	<li>Amazon S3 - hosts the static web files and is a great solution for distributing content</li>
	<li>Twitter Bootstrap - provides fantastic support for responsive web design. I added a good amount of additional stying to give it a unique look though.</li>
	<li>Web Fonts - I am using Raleway and Lato from Google Web Fonts.</li>
</ul>
