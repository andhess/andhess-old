description: My thoughts on Detroit's M-1 rail system
---

<p>Detroit's public transportation system is very unimpressive.</p>

Benefits
Provides a reliable source of transportation for people living on Woodward Ave


Cons
So many people in the Detroit area don't live downtown
Detroit itself is so spread out that this single line can't provide a large enough impact


Alternative Plan: Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)

Pros
An affordable way to provide a far-reaching public transportation system
Would be able to service suburbs and the city
Scalable - easy to add more routes and busses
Changeable - Easy to alter lines as population shifts over time


Cons
Infrastructure needs to build more stations
Will need infrastructure changes on roads to allow for BRT lines to move
Reserving lanes for busses only will increase traffic for personal vehicles
