<p>Two years ago I built a pretty basic website when I was just getting into web design and development. Lately, I was so embarrassed by how poorly it represented me. Since I had some time between the semester and summer work, I decided to start over.</p>
<br>
<p>Comparatively, this site is a big upgrade.  Below are the goals I outlined:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Clean, minimal design</li>
	<li>Support for all screen sizes</li>
	<li>Built in Jekyll, and super fast</li>
</ul>
